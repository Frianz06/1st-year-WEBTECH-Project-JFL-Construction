This website is my Final Output Project for Web System Technologies 1 / WEBTECH 1.

This website, called "JFL Construction" is a website for a Construction Company that we founded in 2022.

As a 1st Year College Student and Upcoming 2nd Year Student, I applied every bit of lessons and techniques

my Professor has taught me as much as I can. I applied what works effectively for the design and output to

showcase the Notable Developments that our Construction Company has built. I want to further my knowledge

in Website Building and gain more understanding of back-end languages that are related to Website Building

such as PHP and SQL to further improve the status and output of the website for it to be a fully functional website. - Frianz06
